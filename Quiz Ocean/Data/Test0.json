She uses three different brands of fertilizer on three separate groups of tomato plants, as well as a group of plants  that will receive no fertilizer. Julia uses cherry tomatoes for her plants. She makes sure to place them in a window sill where they all receive equal amounts of sunlight. The amount of water, the type of soil, and the temperature are kept the same for all of the plants. Over a period of eight weeks, she measures the amount and tomatoes produced by each group. What is the dependent variable in Juliaâ€™s experiment?",
